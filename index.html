                    We developed Degree Admin, a comprehensive course scheduling application designed to streamline the academic planning process. The system supports three distinct user roles: Students can auto-generate complete college schedules based on their major/minor and desired, maximum credit hours per semester. Faculty can review and manage (approve/deny) schedules for their assigned advisees. Administrators can handle system configuration, including account creation and modification of user attributes (e.g., usernames, passwords, and advisor assignments).
